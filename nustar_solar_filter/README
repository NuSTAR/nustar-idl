This version of nustar_solar_filter uses the FTOOLs to generate the
lightcurve and then does some simple filtering on the data.

- Step (1) Make a lightcurve using nuproducts. Use the
  make_nustar_lightcurve.pro IDL wrapper script, which calls nuproducts.

Example:
                                                                                                
IDL> evtfile = 'nu80001085002A01_cl.evt'                                                                    
IDL> nustar_make_lightcurve, evtfile,/no_lc_corr

Note that the default screening energy is 3--20 keV, which is useful
for solar flares.

The "/no_lc_corr" option turns off vignetting and PSF corrections,
which is correct to do for the solar background since it's not
focused by the optics.

This will generate an output file called:

nu80001085002A01_cl_3.00to20.00keV_100.00s_sr.lc

(the filename will change depending on how you change the filtering
parameters and the bin size).

Note that there are other output files also created during this stage
by nuproducts, including a PS version of the lightcurve that's has
been slightly rebinned. You can safely delete or keep these at your
discretion.

- Step (2) Filter out high count rate periods using the
  nustar_filter_lightcuve.pro IDL script.

Example:

IDL> lcfile = 'nu80001085002A01_cl_3.00to20.00keV_100.00s_sr.lc'
IDL> nustar_filter_lightcurve, lcfile, /show

This will plot the lightcurve, the rate cutoff (the default is 0.5
counts / sec which is roughly correct for the 3 to 20 keV band
selected by default above) as a dashed horizontal red line, and
any new GTIs that were created by the script.

The GTIs will appear as vertical green lines with the solid line
showing the start of a GTI and the dashed line showing the end of a
GTI.

If no new GTIs are required then you will get a warning message from
the script.

If new GTIs are required, then the script produces an output file called:

rate_filter_gtis.fits

This file should be used as an input to nuproducts via the usrgtifile
keyword for making spectra, lightcurves, and images.

- Step (3) Optional: Check that the rate file has removed the flare
  events by rerunning Step (1) using the usrgti file.

Example:

IDL> evtfile = 'nu80001085002A01_cl.evt'                                                         
IDL> run_nuproducts_lightcurve, evtfile,/no_lc_corr,usrgti='rate_filter_gtis.fits', outsuffix='_rate_filt'

The usrgti file is now passed to nuproducts when making the
lightcurve. The outsuffix keyword is appended to the output file name
so that you don't overwrite the old lightcurve and can compare the two.

This produces a new output lightcurve file called:

nu80001085002A01_cl_3.00to20.00keV_100.00s_rate_filt_sr.lc

Re-run the filtering to ensure that all of the high bins are removed
using the following:

IDL> new_lcfile = 'nu80001085002A01_cl_3.00to20.00keV_100.00s_rate_filt_sr.lc'
IDL> nustar_filter_lightcurve, new_lcfile, /show
