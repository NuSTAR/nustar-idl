New version of nustar_solar_filter that is based on FTOOLs rather than
IDL workarounds.

- Step (1) Make a lightcurve using nuproducts. Use the
  nustar_make_lightcurve.sh script, which calls nuproducts.

- Step (2) Use XSELECT to filter out "bad" time ranges. I'll see if
  there is an easy way to do this.
