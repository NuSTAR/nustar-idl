The procedures in this directory are a subset of the IDL program library (the
"Coyote library") developed by David Fanning ( http://www.idlcoyote.com/ ).  
They are duplicated here because they are used by other procedures in the
Astronomy library, but they are *not* included in the .tar or .zip distributions
of the Astronomy library.   Users must either separately download the entire 
Coyote library 
  http://www.idlcoyote.com/programs/zip_files/coyoteprograms.zip 
or this directory, which is available as a tar file in
  http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/coyote_astron.tar.gz 
Please inform  wayne.landsman@nasa.gov if there are any discrepancies between 
these procedures and those in the current Coyote library.
